 Current Todos for giRecovery:
	
	Advanced stuff:
 
	 - Instead of using a iRecovery encrypted. Why not just
	   implement iRecovery into giRecovery. This can be done by
	   using MobileDevice.vb by @Fallensn0w. But the file upload
	   isnt supported and exploit so we have to port that aswell.
	  
	 - Implement iRecovery Shell. This could be advanced to do
	   or just really easy. It depends on the developers way.
	   We need to gather the information somehow that iBoot/iBSS
	   dumps, i think the developer could use bulk or just check
	   the original iRecovery src code and see how it's done.
