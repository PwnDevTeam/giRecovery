	giRecovery - Graphical Interface for iRecovery
---------------------------------------------------------------

 I wanted to rewrite giRecovery since the code was so
 messed up and all that shit. The GUI wasn't really
 clean either so i decided to do that, and here it is.

 ATUHOR: Fallensn0w
 
 DATE:   2010-08-09
 
 STABLE VERSION: 2010-08-16
		 
 GOAL :	 Remaking giRecovery and make it more cleaner to use.
		 And improving other stuff like speed.
		 
 BUGS:   When starting, i had to make the output window visible.
		 That is because the program is initializing everything.
		 But its so shortly that you dont mind it. :)
